This is a form validation project.
It is part of the TeamTreehouse Techdegree.
Fields that fail validation turn red and
an error message appears.
There is live feedback for the name and
e-mail field once they lose focus and for
the credit card information as the user types.
Selection options are filtered based on previous
selection.
